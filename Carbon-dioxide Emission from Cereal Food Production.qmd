## Introduction

### Background of the Study

Agricultural practices significantly contribute to the global greenhouse gas emissions particularly through crop production. According to Ricthie (2021), deforestation for agriculture emits approximately 2.6 billion tonnes of (CO~2~) each year, accounting for about 6.5% of global emissions. This phenomenon predominately occurs in tropical regions, where Brazil and Indonesia are the major players in both cereal food production and deforesation. This study utilizes data extracted from Ritchie (2021), which highlights the emission of carbon-dioxide (CO~2~) from cereal food production across forty-four different countries. The data-set includes crucial variables such as country names, cereal products, total carbon-dioxide emissions in tonnes and per capital emissions. The study aims to analyse the carbon-dioxide (CO~2~) emissions associated with cereal food production and assess their environmental impact.

### Objectives of the Study

### General Objective of the Study

1.  The major objective of the study is to analyse the Carbon-dioxide emissions emitted from cereal food production across forty-four countries.

### Specific Objectives of the Study

1.  Convert Carbon-dioxide emissions from tonnes to kilo-tonnes for a clearer understanding of emission across all cereal food products. This conversion will facilitate comparisons and enhance the interpretation of the data.

2.  Perform exploratory data analysis to examine the relationships, trends and insights across all variables such as per capital emission, cereal with the highest range of carbon-dioxide emission and the level of emission from various countries.

3.  Perform inferential analysis to determine if there are significant difference in carbon-dioxide emission across all the various cereal food products.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Importation

1.  The data The cereal data was accessed using the read_csv function from the tidyverse package for data wrangling and manipulation.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse) #data wranging and analysis
library(car) #anova & posthoc test
library(janitor) #data cleaning
library(knitr) #table formatting

cereal_emission <- read_csv('data/emission_data.csv')
cereal_emission |> 
  colnames()
cereal_emission |>
  head() |> 
  kable(
    caption = 'Cereal Food Production'
  )
```

### Conversion of Emissions from Tonnes to Kilo-tonne.

1.  The emission column under the cereal data was converted from tonnes to kilo-tonnes using the mutate function.

```{r}
cereal_emission <-  cereal_emission |> 
  mutate(
    emission = emission / 1000
  )

cereal_emission |> 
  head() |>
  kable(
    caption = 'Cereal Food Production data in Kilotonne'
  )
```

```{r}
cereal_emission |> 
  summary() |> 
  kable(
    caption = 'Summary of the Cereal Food Production'
  )
```

```{r}
cereal_emission |> 
  car::some() |> 
  kable(
    caption = 'Section of the Cereal Food Production'
  )
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

1.  Exploratory data analysis such as **Univariate Analysis** **Bivariate Analysis** and **Multivariate Analysis** were conducted on the data to prepare the data for visualization. The following research questions where asked from the cereal data set.

2.  Total Number of Countries engaged in the cereal production

3.  check the distribution of carbon-dioxide emission and per capital emission

4.  Visualize the emission of individual cereal Production between Australia and Austria

5.  Visualize the emissions generated by each products

### Inferential Statistical Analysis

1.  Inferential statistical analysis was used to determine the difference in emission between products using the anova function from the car package.

2.  Null Hypothesis: There is no significant difference in the emission between products

3.  Alternative Hypothesis: There is significant difference in the emission between products

  )

```{r}

```

## Conclusion

-   The result of the inferential analysis showed there is a significant difference in the emission of carbon-dioxide between the cereal food production (p\<0.05), from the exploratory data analysis it can also be inferred that rice production as the highest range of emission compared to other products. Therefore, rice production emitted the highest range of carbon-dioxide across all countries while wheat and other cereals production had a low carbon-dioxide emission.

-   The exploratory data analysis also showed us that Luxembourg, Brazil and Indonesia generated the highest levels of carbon-dioxide emission from cereal food production.

-   Further analysis is needed to evaluate if the production levels of various products across all countries are the same so as to validate our analysis result which inferred that there is a significant difference in the emission across all products.
